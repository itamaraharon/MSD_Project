# MSD_Project

I created an application called App that prints "Hello world" to the user in Python

I wrote a Dckerfile to create an image for the application

I added a Jenkinsfile that takes the Dockerfile and creates an image and uploads it to Dockerhub

And I addition a yaml file that deploys the application in docker-compose
